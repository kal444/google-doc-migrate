This basically take the documents from one google doc account and move it to another. 
It does this by downloading and re-uploading the document. 
It's not terribly efficient as it work on the files one by one.

There is also logic to attempt to update the sharing of documents shared to you as a writer. 
But it appears that the service isn't supported for that right now. 
I've opened an issue with the google doc api and will see if it gets fixed.

The nice thing with this tool is that it will create a folder that tags the migrated docs. 
So it won't try to migrate them if you execute the tool additional times.
